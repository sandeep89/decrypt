# decrypt

Below you have instructions on how the skeleton project has been set up.

## Up and running

First, install dependencies. The back-end is a simple Flask API, so you'll
probably want to set up a virtual environment as well. These commands assume
that you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (with npm) installed.

```
pyvenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now that you have everything installed, you can build and run the app with one

```
python decrypt.py
```
